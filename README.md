<h1>Wordle Guesser</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
Wordle is a web-based word game in which players are given six chances to guess a five-letter word, with coloured tiles providing feedback when letters match or are in the correct position. My program was built to determine the optimal word to guess next using basic python code and file input.

<h3>Future Updates</h3>
My program runsÂ slowly the first time, hence optimisation is my main emphasis for this project. I'd like to modify and improve my code so that it doesn't run slowly on the first guess.
